Business districts flourished with new office buildings and commercial spaces, attracting workers from rural areas seeking better-paying jobs. This influx fueled urbanization, prompting many to relocate closer to their offices to minimize long commutes, especially since shifts often extended into the night, leading to more densely populated residential areas near these bustling work centers. With large call centers operating 24/7, business districts remained vibrant, creating a unique atmosphere where streets were filled with employees at all hours. For many, life revolved around the office, with homes primarily serving as convenient places to rest. This shift not only spurred economic growth but also introduced challenges like traffic congestion and increased demand for housing and local services.

With the rise of freelancing and digital work, many can work from the comfort of their homes, regardless of location. Some have even embraced this flexibility by living in rural areas or provinces while serving international clients or running online businesses. This shift has contributed to reduced crowding in urban centers, as more professionals prioritize remote work for a better work-life balance and a quieter lifestyle. In response to this evolving landscape, co-working spaces have gained popularity, providing dynamic environments for freelancers who seek a change of scenery. These spaces foster collaboration among independent workers while offering amenities like high-speed internet and meeting rooms. Consequently, the notion of `workspaces` has transformed; it is no longer limited to traditional office buildings in busy cities. People can now create productive work environments in various settings, reflecting a broader societal shift toward valuing flexibility and the ability to balance professional and personal lives more effectively.
