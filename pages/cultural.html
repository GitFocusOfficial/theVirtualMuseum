One notable example was the renovation of the Bonifacio Global City (BGC) in Taguig, which began in the early 2000s and evolved into a vibrant urban hub by 2010. The creation of these spaces fostered a sense of community and belonging, as they provided venues for cultural expression and recreational activities. The vibrant atmosphere of BGC and similar developments resonated with many Filipinos, instilling pride in urban renewal and promoting a more active lifestyle. These changes reflected broader societal shifts towards valuing public spaces and encouraged Filipinos to engage more with their environment, highlighting the importance of accessible areas for community interaction and cultural expression in an increasingly urbanized society.', 200, 5, 'Roch Mar Maray')"></td>

AI will help companies from different countries work together more easily by automating tasks, translating languages instantly, and providing smart solutions for problems. For example, AI could help doctors in one country collaborate with researchers in another or help businesses run more efficiently without needing as many people. This will make products and services cheaper and faster to deliver to everyone, no matter where they live. While AI will create new opportunities, it will also change the types of jobs people do, as more tasks become automated. However, countries will need to work together to make sure AI is used fairly and safely, to avoid leaving anyone behind in this new, connected world', 400, 12, 'Roch Mar Maray')"></td>
